HI, I'm Darren Burns. I am a health economist / econometrician with a keen interest in `R` and its use within the Health Economics Outcomes Research (HEOR) sphere. In particular I'm interested in how we can use `R` more in automated reporting of cost-effectiveness evaluations of health technologies in order to reduce repeated effort and focus on important decision making.  

I am really excited for the potential of using `distill`, `bookdown` and packages within the `shinyverse` to semi-automate many of the processes which remain unecessarily laborious in our field. As comparisons between health technologies get more complicated, it is becoming more and more difficult to justify the use of old inflexible technologies, and eventually a tipping point will be reached! Once it is, I am hoping to be ready.  

I am looking to collaborate on projects relating to `R` in HTA, semi-automation of evaluations and decision making on the components which can/should be automatic. I am also looking to collaborate on statistics projects, as well as topics relating to health economics low and middle income countries (an area of personal interest)
